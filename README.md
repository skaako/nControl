nControl MQTT project files

The MQTT_Servo_Led file is used to program the ESP8266. This will allow it to control 1 servo and 1 3-Aspect signal. The MQTT topics are in the file but can be changed to whatever suits. 

When first trying out the ESP I would recommend starting off with the examples that come with the library just to make sure it is working correctly.

# nControl
nControl MQTT project files

The MQTT_Servo_Led file is used to program the ESP8266. This will allow it to control 1 servo and 1 3-Aspect signal. The MQTT topics are in the file but can be changed to whatever suits. 

Track3.4.NCP is an example file to use with nControl to test out MQTT communications to the servo LED controllers. This is a work in progress.

When first trying out the ESP I would recommend starting off with the examples that come with the library just to make sure it is working correctly.
